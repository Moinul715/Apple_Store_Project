Great catch, Moinul! Here's the final question—**Question 20**—along with its SQL solution, completing your full set of business questions and answers:

### 20. What are the monthly running totals of sales revenue for each store over the past four years, and how do trends compare across time?
```sql
WITH monthly_sales AS (
    SELECT 
        s.store_id,
        EXTRACT(YEAR FROM s.sale_date) AS year,
        EXTRACT(MONTH FROM s.sale_date) AS month,
        SUM(p.price * s.quantity) AS total_revenue
    FROM sales s
    JOIN products p ON s.product_id = p.product_id
    WHERE s.sale_date >= CURRENT_DATE - INTERVAL '4 years'
    GROUP BY s.store_id, year, month
)
SELECT 
    store_id,
    year,
    month,
    total_revenue,
    SUM(total_revenue) OVER (
        PARTITION BY store_id 
        ORDER BY year, month
    ) AS running_total
FROM monthly_sales
ORDER BY store_id, year, month;
