# Apple_Store_Project (2024)


## üìä Apple Retail Sales Analysis Using Advanced SQL  
**A Portfolio Project Featuring Over 1 Million Rows of Global Sales Data**

This project demonstrates advanced SQL querying techniques applied to a large-scale dataset from Apple retail operations. With over 1 million rows of data spanning global store locations, product categories, sales transactions, and warranty claims, the project simulates real-world business scenarios that data analysts frequently encounter.

The objective is to extract actionable insights, optimize query performance, and apply analytical thinking to solve complex business questions using structured data.

## üß± Database Overview

The analysis is based on a relational database with five core tables:

1. **stores** ‚Äì Apple retail locations, including store name, city, and country.
2. **category** ‚Äì Product categories such as iPhones, iPads, and accessories.
3. **products** ‚Äì Product-level details including launch date and price.
4. **sales** ‚Äì Transaction-level data capturing product sales across stores.
5. **warranty** ‚Äì Warranty claim records linked to sales, with claim status.

This schema supports a wide range of analytical use cases, from performance benchmarking to customer behavior analysis.

## üîç Project Objectives

The project is structured into three tiers of complexity to showcase a progression of SQL skills:

### Tier 1: Foundational Analysis (10 Queries)
- Store distribution by country
- Total units sold per store
- Monthly sales volume (e.g., December 2023)
- Stores with zero warranty claims
- Percentage of claims marked as "Warranty Void"
- Top-performing store by units sold (last 12 months)
- Unique products sold in the past year
- Average product price by category
- Warranty claims filed in a specific year (e.g., 2020)
- Best-selling day per store based on quantity sold

### Tier 2: Intermediate Business Insights (5 Queries)
- Least-selling product per country per year
- Warranty claims filed within 180 days of purchase
- Claims associated with recently launched products (last 2 years)
- High-volume sales months in the USA (over 5,000 units)
- Most-claimed product category in the past two years

### Tier 3: Advanced Analytical Challenges (5 Queries)
- Country-wise probability of a warranty claim per purchase
- Year-over-year growth analysis by store
- Correlation between product price and warranty claims (segmented by price range)
- Store with the highest proportion of ‚ÄúPaid Repaired‚Äù claims
- Monthly running total of sales per store over four years, with trend comparison

### Bonus Analysis
- Product lifecycle sales trends segmented into:
  - 0‚Äì6 months post-launch
  - 6‚Äì12 months
  - 12‚Äì18 months
  - Beyond 18 months
